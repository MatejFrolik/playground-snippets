My **LINKEDIN** [HERE](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matěj-frol%C3%ADk-183812230/).

## Overview
This project presents an analytical dashboard focused on employee turnover trends in a manufacturing-like environment.  
It demonstrates how workforce data can be modeled, analyzed, and visualized to support HR and management decision-making.

---

## Project Goal
The goal of this project was to provide a detailed overview of employee turnover and related factors over time.

The dashboard includes insights such as:
- turnover rate across different time periods
- reasons for employee turnover
- turnover by department, section, and team leads
- impact of supervisor training on turnover
- relationships between turnover, absenteeism, and overtime

## Data Disclaimer
All data used in this project are **synthetic and anonymized**.

The datasets:
- simulate HR and attendance system outputs
- are inspired by typical workforce data structures
- do **not** represent any real company, organization, or employees

This project is intended **solely for demonstration and learning purposes**.

---

## Project Workflow
1. Data ingestion from simulated external HR and attendance data sources.
2. Data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query**.
3. Integration of prepared datasets into **Power BI**.
4. Creation of a relational data model linking HR, attendance, and turnover information.
5. Calculation of required measures and derived columns for analytical purposes.
6. Development of multiple report pages highlighting key turnover metrics and relationships.

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Power Query
- Microsoft Excel (as a staging layer)
- DAX (calculated columns and measures)

---

## Notes
- This project represents a longer-term analytical effort rather than a short technical exercise.
- The focus is on data modeling, metric definition, and insight generation.
- Visual design prioritizes clarity and interpretability over visual complexity.
