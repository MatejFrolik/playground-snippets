## Project Workflow
1. Data ingestion from simulated external HR and attendance data sources.
2. Data cleaning and transformation using **Power Query**.
3. Integration of prepared datasets into **Power BI**.
4. Creation of a relational data model linking HR, attendance, and turnover information.
5. Calculation of required measures and derived columns for analytical purposes.
6. Development of multiple report pages highlighting key turnover metrics and relationships.
