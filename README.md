# Playground Snippets

This repository contains a collection of small learning projects, experiments, and code snippets related to data analytics, BI, and automation.

The purpose of this repository is to keep non-production and exploratory work in one place, clearly separated from my main portfolio projects.

## Contents

- **SQL** – query experiments, data transformations, analytical queries
- **Python** – web scraping, data processing, ETL prototypes
- **Power BI** – dashboard drafts, data modeling experiments
- **Excel** – reporting and visualization experiments
- **ETL / Automation** – pipeline experiments and workflow prototypes
- **Misc** – other technical or analytical exercises

## Notes

- These projects are learning-oriented or exploratory.
- Code quality and structure may vary between projects.
- This repository is not intended to represent production-ready work.

## Main Portfolio

For production-ready and end-to-end analytics projects, please refer to the highlighted repositories on my GitHub profile.
